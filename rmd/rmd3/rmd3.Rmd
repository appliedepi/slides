# Thank you for joining us  

Brief introductions from the instructors  

**Thank you for your service** *to your community in these busy times for public health. We are glad that you are taking the time to learn R with us.*

# Outline

 1. Powerpoint Slides 
 2. Xaringan Slides 
 3. Introduction to Github 
 4. Hosting websites

# Powerpoint Slides

Yes, you can make powerpoint slides with RMarkdown easily!

# Powerpoint Slides

Yes, you can make powerpoint slides with RMarkdown easily! 

What if you have an RMarkdown **Word Document** or **Dashboard** you'd like to present as slides at a meeting? 

We can easily create **Powerpoint Slides** with the same content.

---

# Default Output

You can make an RMarkdown output to powerpoint, simiarly to HTML and DOCX as you have before. Instead of creating sections with the **#** headings, we'll be creating slides.

Script: 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "pptx_script.png")))

```

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "pptx_output.png")))

```

---

# Using a template

If your organization wants to create powerpoints with a pre-exisiting template, RMarkdown can take this as an input.

Example of YAML header using a powerpoint template: 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "pptx_script_temp.png")))

```

```

---

# Plots in powerpoint

With the same code we have used previously, we can create plots in the body of slides.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "pptx_slide2_temp.png")))

```

# HTML slides

# Xaringan

We can create PDF slides with `xaringan` package and RMarkdown. These slides were created with `xaringan`! 

As long as you have a template, creating the slides can be just as simple as creating powerpoints.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "xaringan_temp.png")))

```

# Xaringan template

In your course folder, you will find a template {xaringan} slide deck.

# Intro to Github

# Intro to Github


GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.  

.caption[
Check out the [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) website!

---
# How does Github work?

A **local** version of your code on your computer is linked to an **online** version of the code.

You and your team can collaborate and get access to the most updated code easily.

No more sending code via email or coordinating who is making edits on shared drives.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "github_viz.png")))
```


---
# Getting started with Github

First **make an account** at https://www.github.com/login. 

*Click "Create new account" at the bottom of the page.*

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "github_signin.png")))
```

---
# Getting started with Github

Follow the prompts to create your account.

*Try to use an email address that will never expire.* 

*Work email addresses are not ideal, but will work.*

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "newaccount.png")))
```

---
# Github Language

 - Repository or **repo**: folder where your project scripts are stored. 
 - **Organization**: a collection of repos. 
 
Below is an example landing page. On the left we can see a list of existing repos this person contributes to, and on the right we can see the menu where you can create new repos.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "landing_newrepo.png")))
```
 
---
# Use Github Desktop 

Typically, you can use the command line to send changes to github.com from your computer and retrieve changes from github.com to your computer.

Instead, use Github Desktop to use Github more easily.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd3", "github_desktop.png")))
```

 
---
# More Github Language

 - **Pull**: pull changes from github.com version of the repo to your local repo.  
 - **Commit**: finalize changes from your repo. 
 - **Push**: push the committed changes from your local repo to github.com. 

---
# Github Resources

There are many resources online. Github's mission is to make code accessible, and because of this, they have extremely good documentation online:  

**Applied Epi will offer a course in 2024 on how to use Git, Github, and R together for version control and collaboration - email us for info!**
