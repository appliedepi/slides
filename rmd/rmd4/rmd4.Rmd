# Key Terminologies and Concepts

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.cap="Designed by FreePik", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd4", "warning.png")))
```

## Static vs. Dynamic Content

.pull-left[

#### Static Content
- Defined as content that does not change after it has been rendered
- E.g. HTML, PDF, or Word

#### Dynamic Content
- Defined as content that can change in response to user input or other external conditions
- E.g. Embedded Shiny applications 

]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Produced using OpenAI DALL-E", fig.align='left'}

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd4", "static_dynamic_illustration.png")))
```

]

???
Simplified points:

Static Content:
- Unchanging post-render
- RMarkdown knit output (HTML, PDF, Word) consistent
- Ideal for static reports, research papers

Dynamic Content:

- Changes with user input or conditions
- Embeds Shiny in RMarkdown for interactivity
- Ideal for dashboards, data exploration

---
## Static RMarkdown

.pull-left[
- **Static content** refers to files generated from RMarkdown that are served exactly as stored
- Once rendered **static outputs** like HTML, PDF, or Word files remain consistent regardless of user or time of access
- **Ideal** for distributing reports, research findings, and documentation where interactivity may not be required
- Typically requires less server resources; can be hosted on simple web servers or services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/)
]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Image by AppliedEpi", out.height="125%"}

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd4", "static_outputs.png")))
```
]


???

Simplified points:

- Static RMarkdown: unchanging files post-render
- Formats: HTML, PDF, Word
- Same view for every user, any time
- Ideal for fixed reports, papers, docs
- Simple web server hosting suffices
- Less resource-intensive than dynamic content
- GitHub Pages, RPubs common hosts

---
## Dynamic RMarkdown

- **Dynamic RMarkdown** content is interactive and changes in response to user actions or data updates
- Includes **Shiny apps** embedded in RMarkdown, which allow users to manipulate data and visualizations in real time
- Needs a server capable of processing R code on-the-fly, like [Shiny Server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/) or [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/tags/connect/)


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Image by AppliedEpi", out.width = "75%"}

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmd4", "dynamic_output.png")))
```


???

Simplified points:

- Dynamic RMarkdown: interactive, user-responsive
- Integrates RMarkdown with Shiny
- Needs R code-processing server
- Updates in real-time, no refresh
- Increases user engagement
- Host on Shiny Server, RStudio Connect
- Suits educational tools, data apps, business dashboards

---

## Understanding Servers

.pull-left[

- **Servers** are specialized computers that store, process, and serve content to users over the internet or an internal network
- **Server-side (backend)** operations process tasks on the server, providing dynamic content based on user interaction, the **client-side (frontend)** is what the user interacts with directly
- **Hosting** is the service of providing storage space on a server for a website or application, making it accessible via the internet.

## Hosting Service Types

| Hosting Type           | Characteristics |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Shared Hosting**     | Cost-effective, multiple websites on one server, limited resources and less control |
| **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** | A step up from shared hosting, offers more control and dedicated resources |
| **Dedicated Hosting**  | An entire server for one website, full control, high performance, and security |
| **Cloud Hosting**      | Flexible, scalable hosting that uses multiple servers, often pay-as-you-go pricing |
| **Managed Hosting**    | The hosting provider takes care of server maintenance, security, and support |

???
Simplified points:

- Shared hosting: cost-effective, shared resources
- VPS: more control, dedicated resources
- Dedicated hosting: full control, high performance
- Cloud hosting: flexible, scalable
- Managed hosting: provider-managed maintenance and security
- Choose based on content type, traffic, budget, expertise

## Managing Dynamic Content on Internal Servers

- Deploying dynamic RMarkdown content, like Shiny apps, requires an internal server configured to handle interactive sessions.
- Utilize Shiny Server or RStudio Connect for application hosting and management.
- Server resources match the demands of your dynamic content for reliability and performance.

???
Important to mention here that the process of hosting dynamic content on an internal server is even more complex it may require containersation and then furhter management of containers (orchestration) using software like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage deployment, scaling and load balancing.

Below is a simplified step-by-step
- Install Shiny Server or RStudio Connect
- Configure server for dynamic requests
- Deploy Shiny apps to server
- Set security and authentication
- Monitor and allocate resources
- Maintain with regular updates
- Troubleshoot as needed
- Comply with health data regulations
