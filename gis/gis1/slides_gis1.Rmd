# Why use R for GIS?

## Efficient

Once you have written the code once, there is no need to point and click and re-do analysis with updated data, you can reuse your old code! Which means that R is...

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "welcome", "efficient_image.PNG")))
```

???
Mention marketable skill as well as technically for epidemic response

---
# Why use R for GIS?

## Reproducible  

We can re-run the same code and get the same outcome, or use new data and see how findings have changed. Because it is written as a script it is reproducible, and...

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "welcome", "clone_image.jpg")))
```


---
# Why use R for GIS?

## Shareable  

You can share scripts and other people can produce the same findings and results as you. This makes it easy to produce automated reports and share the work between people.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "welcome", "shareable_image.png")))
```

# Why use R for GIS?

## Easy (once you learn the syntax!)  

.pull-left[ We know that R can be scary (it was for us too when we first learned it!), but once you learn the basics, and how to apply these to GIS methods in R, you can very quickly produce in depth analysis of data in an efficient, effective and reproducible way!

     - Points
     - Lines
     - Polygons
- Collection of *at minimum* 3 file types: **.shp**, **.shx**, **.dbf**
- All 3 components needed to read shapefile

# Spatial joins

 - We want to combine two dataframes with *common columns* 
 - Multiple different types of joins available from {sf}
     - `st_join`   (remember left joins?)
     - `st_touches`
     - `st_crosses`
     - `st_contains`
     - `st_within`
     - `st_overlaps`
     - `st_covers`
     - `st_covered_by`
     - `st_is_within_distance`

# Admin levels and joins

## How is your survey data formatted?

What type of spatial data do you have in your survey data? In your shape files? 

- Administrative levels e.g. Adm1, Adm2, Adm3
- Districts, e.g. by name or by number
- Countries or regional separations e.g. England and Wales vs. United Kingdom
- Longitude and latitude

Once we consider the format, we can think about how to join our survey data with our shape files! We will get plenty of practice in the exercises today.

# {ggplot2} and basemaps

---
# gg-what??  

--

- The **ggplot2** *package* is the most popular data visualization tool in R  

--

- Its `ggplot()` *function* is at the core of the package  

--

- This whole approach is colloquially known as “ggplotting”  

--

- Resulting figures are sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”  

--

**ggplot2** benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that extends its functionalities, such as **gganimate**, **ggthemr**, **ggdendro**, **gghighlight**, **ggforce**...  

.footnote[
*Bonus question:* What does the "gg” in these names represent?
]

???
- "gg" represents the “grammar of graphics” used to construct the figures 


---
# Syntax overview  

Build a plot object by “adding” commands on top of one another that specify plot layers and design elements  


--

The order of layers will usually look like this:

1) **"Open" the plot** with the `ggplot()` command and specify the dataset  

--

2) **"Map" data columns** to "aesthetic" features of the plot such as axes, color, size, shape, fill, transparency  

--

3) **Add (`+`) “geom” layers** that visualize data geometrically as shapes  

--

4) **Modify "scales"**, such as a color scale or y-axis breaks  

--

5) **Add "theme" plot design elements** such as axis labels, title, caption, fonts, text sizes, background themes, or axes rotation  

--

These layers are "added" sequentially with `+` symbols.  
**ggplot2** commands can be quite long!  


???
Remember that although the commands may be long, it is infinitely easier to edit and recycle than in Excel

# Basemaps

.pull-left[
- A screenshot of the map area

- A lot of different R packages
    - We demonstrate {ggspatial}
    - Able to save tiles for offline use
    - Also have scalebars

# Adding the data


Once we have our basemap we might want to consider creating a bounding box around our feature of interest. This could include considering: 

- Where is our outbreak located and which features are we interested in? 
    - Across the whole country?
    - Only specific districts? 
    - Cases and hospitals?
    - Schools? Specific age groups?
    - Gender? Severity of case?
--

Once we've identified our features of interest, we can add these as **another layer** to our **ggplot**
- Use `geom_sf()` to plot data as layer (e.g. cases)
- Data object must be of class `sf`
- End up layering multiple dataframes (objects) with different `geom_sf` layers
- We will go through this format in the demo shortly

# Example plot

**Note** basemap is centered **around cases** rather than including the whole country. What would this look like if the whole country was included instead? 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "130%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "simulated_ebola_outbreak.png")))

# Choropleth maps

# Choropleth maps



Sometimes you may not want to show exact location of points, but rather *counts* per *district* or *admin level* instead. We can create *choropleth* maps which show counts by area. 

- Allows use to visualise case counts across a larger region
- How do we need to re-format our data to create a *choropleth* map? 
   - Create a **new** dataframe that summarises *case counts by district*
   - **Join** this with your district or adm shape files 
   - Plot your choropleth with {ggplot2}! 
   - Remember instead of colour for points you will use fill for areas




```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "choropleth_example.png")))

# Heat maps

# Heat maps

Rather than points or lines, we plot the interpolated (smoothed) "density" of points. 

- Overlapping points can obscure the spatial distribution
- Heat maps allow us to see easily visualise the spatial distribution

`stat_density2d_filled()` function from the {ggplot2} package using the **original** `data= surv` dataframe (**NOT** an *"sf"* object)
- mapping x to `lon` and `lat` columns
- play around with `alpha =` to see basemap through heat map layer

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "heatmaps.png")))

```
---

# Heat maps

How to create a heat map:

1. Open an OpenstreetMap base mp cropped to cases with `base_osm_cropped()`
2. Add `stat_density2d_filled()` to the ggplot geom layers
3. Add district boundaries with with white outline on top 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Add administrative boundaries, cases, facilities
# You have to use inherit.aes = FALSE is you're using the ggmap basemap
ggplot()+
  # base map cropped to cases
  geom_spatraster_rgb(data = base_osm_cropped)+
  
  # density of case points 
  stat_density2d_filled(data = surv,
                        mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat),
                        alpha = 0.5) +
  # admin boundaries
  geom_sf(data = sle_adm3_cropped,
          fill = NA,
          color = "white")

```

# Heat maps
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "heat_map.png")))
