# Course recap 

So far we have used multiple data sources to learn about: 

- Shapefiles, {sf}, and CRS
- Spatial joins and admin levels
- {ggplot2}, basemaps, and bounding boxes
- Choropleth maps
- Spatial analysis including NN, buffer analysis, and heat maps

---

# Shapefiles and CRS

.pull-left[
In future analyses, we need to think about: 

- Where to source shape files from? 
  - Google is your friend! 
  - Open source resources 
  - Open source resources
  - There are *many more* resources not listed here! 
- Different regions use different types of CRS
  - E.g. Sierra Leone
  - E.g. Fulton county
  - What does your work region use? *Look it up!* 
]

.pull-right[
   
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "shapefiles_final.png")))
```
]

---

# Importance of admin levels

We must always consider which administrative level to use: 

.pull-left[

- admin1, admin2, admin3, country, district, zip codes, etc. 
- How can we join our survey data and our shape files? 
 - `st_joins`, `st_within`, and many more options available
- At what stage do we format our survey data to class `sf`?
 - Before joining with shape files or after?
- How do we want our data formatted?
 - District or admin level choropleths? 
 - Points of cases using lat and lon

# Spatial analysis 

We have only touched the tip of the iceberg! There are many other more advanced methods. Some examples and tutorials available:  

- Nearest Neighbour analysis using road networks 
   - Add link to tutorial 
- Other methods add in when landed
