# Spatial analysis

.pull-left[
Spatial analysis allows you to:
- Explore and understand your data from a geographical perspective
- Determine relationships, detect and quantify trends or patterns
- Make predictions and decisions about your data

We will focus on 3 types of spatial analysis: 
- Nearest Neighbour
- Buffer
- Heat maps
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "john_snow_map.png")))
```


]

# Nearest Neighbour


---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

Analyse the *nearest feature* in **one layer** to the *nearest feature* in **another layer**. For example: 
- The closest hospitals to refugee camps or displaced groups
- The closest net-dispensary to rural villages
- The closest school to a particular residence

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "dh_nn.png")))
```

---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

## In practice: 

- Create a **new object** to join layers (cases + health facilities) for NN analysis 
- Use `join = st_nearest_feature`argument for `st_join()`#
    - Calculates and appends nearest health facility to case

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# begin with the linelist, and join data from the nearest clinic
surv_adm_hf <- st_join(surv_adm, sle_hf, join = st_nearest_feature)

```

--

The nearest neighbour is identifiable as two columns in the **new object**: 

- *"osm_id"*
- *"name"* 

--

Which column do you think is **better** to use to **id** nearest health facilities? 

---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

## Other useful functions: 

`st_nearest_feature()` allows you to identify the nearest health facility for each case 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# identify the nearest health facility for each case
# this information is saved as a vector with one value for each case
nearest_index <- st_nearest_feature(
  x = surv_adm,      # linelist data 
  y = sle_hf)        # health facility location

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

nearest_index

```


---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

## Other useful functions: 

`st_distance()` allows you to identify the distance between each case and its nearest health facility


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# output is a vector of distances, with same length as the # of cases
# the unit for the distance is listed at the top (m for meters)
distances <- st_distance(
  x = surv_adm,
  y = sle_hf[nearest_index,],
  by_element = TRUE)

```

--
We can add `distances` as a column in our `surv_adm_hf` dataframe

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# add the distances as a new column in surv_adm_hf
surv_adm_hf$nearest_dist <- as.numeric(distances)
```
---

# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

### How to plot NN analyses?

- Colour cases (points) by **specific** nearest hospital facility
- Colour cases by distance to *any* nearest hospital facility
- Colour cases by <= 1km vs. > 1 km away from nearest hospital facility
- Other ways to visualise nearest neighbours? 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "travel_times_example.png")))
```

---

# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

### How to calculate distance?

.pull-left[
For this class:
- "Euclidean" or straight-line distances

Other methods: 

- Road, river, or other transport networks (see [example](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/451410/doing-nearest-neighbors-accounting-for-road-distance-in-r))
- Accounting for spatial topology (e.g. mountains)
- Other methods of distance we might want to consider? 

]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "road_networks.png")))
```

# Buffer analysis

---
# Buffer analysis

.pull-left[
Calculate *"buffers"* or areas of a particular radius around points or lines. 

Examples of buffers of interest:
- Identify displaced groups more than 5km from a health facility
- Identify residences more than 10km away from schools in rural areas
- Identify 5km cachement areas of methadone clinics (gaps in access)


Other buffers that could be of interest?
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "buffer_zones_example.png")))
```


]

---
# Buffer analysis

### How to create buffers in R? 

`st_buffer()` function from the {sf} package
- provide buffer radius in meters to `dist =` argument 
- creates circles around your feature of interest

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# create new layer (polygons/circles) of 1km buffer
# around each health facility

sle_hf_outbreak_1k <- st_buffer(sle_hf_outbreak, dist = 1000)

#dist = 1000 is equivalent to 1000 meters

```


---

# Buffer analysis

### Plotting with buffers

Adding a buffer layer to ggplot():

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sle_adm3_outbreak) + # outbreak admin boundaries
  geom_sf(data = sle_hf_outbreak,     # each health facility
          color="red")+
  geom_sf(data = sle_hf_outbreak_1k,  # radius around health facilities
          color = "black",
          fill = NA)

```

But what about **overlaps** in buffer zones?

---

# Buffer analysis


.pull-left[

**Overlapping zones**

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "buffer_no_union.png")))
```


]

.pull-right[

**United zones**

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "gis", "buffer_union.png")))
```

]

---
# Buffer analysis

We can combine buffers via a **union**

- `st_union()` function joins overlapping buffers together
- `st_as_sf()` is required after to convert to *"sf"* class

```{r eval = F, echo=T}
sle_hf_outbreak_1k <- sle_hf_outbreak %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 1000) %>% # lengths in meters
  st_union() %>%             # combine overlaps into a single shape
  st_as_sf()                 # convert to sf class
```

--

Why is it useful to combine buffers together? 

--

- Easily identify cases within an overlapping area
    - Working with small distances, unclear where a case will go
    - Cases can fall under broader overlapping buffer areas

# Interactive maps

---
# Interactive maps

R has excellent **interactive* GIS capabilities

- {leaflet}, {tmap}, {mapview} can all be used to produce interactive maps
- these maps allow users to pan, scroll, zoom, select, etc. 
- interactive maps can be shared in HTML outbreak situation reports, dashboards, shiny apps, etc. 

The exercises today will provide an opportunity to work through an example using {lealet}. 

---

# {leaflet}

The `leaflet()` function opens an interactive space in the RStudio Viewer pane

- `addTiles()` accesses OpenStreetMap base tiles
- `addMarkers()` centers the map using `lat = ` and `lng =` arguments
    - *NOTE* the argument is `lng` not `lon`
- `addPolygons()` adds shapefiles provided to the map
  - adjust fill, outline, opacity and other settings
  - e.g. lines around polygons with `stroke = TRUE`
- `colorBin()` to create a palette function 
- `addLegend()` to add legend to interactive plot

---

# Example interactive plot

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
# create color palette function
palette <- colorFactor(
  palette = c("red", "black"),
  domain = c("Death", "Recover"))

surv_adm_map <- leaflet(surv_adm) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%           # OpenStreetMap
  addCircleMarkers(popup = ~case_id,
                   radius = 1,
             label = ~case_id,
             color = ~palette(outcome),
             fillOpacity = 1) 

surv_adm_map
```
