# This session: objectives &amp; schedule  

**In this module we aim to help you:**  
* Perform nearest neighbour analysis 
* Perform buffer analysis
* Learn to code heat maps and interactive maps
* Create publication ready maps

# Spatial analysis

.pull-left[
Spatial analysis allows you to:
- Explore and understand your data from a geographical perspective
- Determine relationships, detect and quantify trends or patterns
- Make predictions and decisions about your data

We will focus on 3 types of spatial analysis: 
- Nearest Neighbour
- Buffer
- Heat maps

# Nearest Neighbour


---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

Analyse the *nearest feature* in **one layer** to the *nearest feature* in **another layer**. For example: 
- The closest hospitals to refugee camps or displaced groups
- The closest net-dispensary to rural villages
- The closest school to a particular residence

&lt;img src="../../images/gis/dh_nn.png" width="90%" /&gt;

---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

## In practice: 

- Create a **new object** to join layers (cases + health facilities) for NN analysis 
- Use `join = st_nearest_feature` argument for `st_join()`
    - Calculates and appends nearest health facility to case

--


```r
# begin with the linelist, and join data from the nearest clinic
surv_adm_hf &lt;- st_join(surv_adm, sle_hf, join = st_nearest_feature)
```

--

The nearest neighbour is identifiable as two columns in the **new object**: 

- *"osm_id"*
- *"name"* 

--

Which column do you think is **better** to use to **id** nearest health facilities? 

---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

## Other useful functions: 

`st_nearest_feature()` allows you to identify the nearest health facility for each case 


```r
# identify the nearest health facility for each case
# this information is saved as a vector with one value for each case
nearest_index &lt;- st_nearest_feature(
  x = surv_adm,      # linelist data 
  y = sle_hf)        # health facility location
```




---
# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

## Other useful functions: 

`st_distance()` allows you to identify the distance between each case and its nearest health facility



```r
# output is a vector of distances, with same length as the # of cases
# the unit for the distance is listed at the top (m for meters)
distances &lt;- st_distance(
  x = surv_adm,
  y = sle_hf[nearest_index,],
  by_element = TRUE)
```

--
We can add `distances` as a column in our `surv_adm_hf` dataframe


```r
# add the distances as a new column in surv_adm_hf
surv_adm_hf$nearest_dist &lt;- as.numeric(distances)
```
---

# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

### How to plot NN analyses?

- Colour cases (points) by **specific** nearest hospital facility
- Colour cases by distance to *any* nearest hospital facility
- Colour cases by &lt;= 1km vs. &gt; 1 km away from nearest hospital facility
- Other ways to visualise nearest neighbours?

# Nearest Neighbour (NN)

### How to calculate distance?

.pull-left[
For this class:
- "Euclidean" or straight-line distances

Other methods: 

- Road, river, or other transport networks (see [example](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/451410/doing-nearest-neighbors-accounting-for-road-distance-in-r))
- Accounting for spatial topology (e.g. mountains)
- Other methods of distance we might want to consider?

# Buffer analysis

# Buffer analysis

.pull-left[
Calculate *"buffers"* or areas of a particular radius around points or lines. 

Examples of buffers of interest:
- Identify displaced groups more than 5km from a health facility
- Identify residences more than 10km away from schools in rural areas
- Identify 5km cachement areas of methadone clinics (gaps in access)


Other buffers that could be of interest?

# Buffer analysis

### How to create buffers in R? 

`st_buffer()` function from the {sf} package
- provide buffer radius in meters to `dist =` argument 
- creates circles around your feature of interest


```r
# create new layer (polygons/circles) of 1km buffer
# around each health facility

sle_hf_outbreak_1k &lt;- st_buffer(sle_hf_outbreak, dist = 1000)

#dist = 1000 is equivalent to 1000 meters
```


---

# Buffer analysis

### Plotting with buffers

Adding a buffer layer to ggplot():


```r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sle_adm3_outbreak) + # outbreak admin boundaries
  geom_sf(data = sle_hf_outbreak,     # each health facility
          color="red")+
  geom_sf(data = sle_hf_outbreak_1k,  # radius around health facilities
          color = "black",
          fill = NA)
```

But what about **overlaps** in buffer zones?

---

# Buffer analysis


.pull-left[

**Overlapping zones**

&lt;img src="../../images/gis/buffer_no_union.png" width="80%" /&gt;


]

.pull-right[

**United zones**

&lt;img src="../../images/gis/buffer_union.png" width="80%" /&gt;

]

---
# Buffer analysis

We can combine buffers via a **union**

- `st_union()` function joins overlapping buffers together
- `st_as_sf()` is required after to convert to *"sf"* class


```r
sle_hf_outbreak_1k &lt;- sle_hf_outbreak %&gt;%
  st_buffer(dist = 1000) %&gt;% # length in meters
  st_union() %&gt;%             # combine overlaps into a single shape
  st_as_sf()                 # convert to sf class
```

--

Why is it useful to combine buffers together? 

--

- Easily identify cases within an overlapping area
    - Working with small distances, unclear where a case will go
    - Cases can fall under broader overlapping buffer areas

# Interactive maps

---
# Interactive maps

R has excellent **interactive** GIS capabilities

- {leaflet}, {tmap}, {mapview} can all be used to produce interactive maps
- These maps allow users to pan, scroll, zoom, select, etc. 
- Interactive maps can be shared in HTML outbreak situation reports, dashboards, shiny apps, etc. 

The exercises today will provide an opportunity to work through an example using {lealet}. 

---

# {leaflet}

The `leaflet()` function opens an interactive space in the RStudio Viewer pane

- `addTiles()` accesses OpenStreetMap base tiles
- `addMarkers()` centers the map using `lat = ` and `lng =` arguments
    - *NOTE* the argument is `lng` not `lon`
- `addPolygons()` adds shapefiles provided to the map
  - adjust fill, outline, opacity and other settings
  - e.g. lines around polygons with `stroke = TRUE`
- `colorBin()` to create a palette function 
- `addLegend()` to add legend to interactive plot

---
