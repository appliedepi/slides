### COVID-19 Case Study

# Today: objectives & schedule  

**In this module we aim to help you:**  

* Apply your learning to a new dataset, without code solutions readily available  

--

* See outputs and replicate them using R  

--

* Write original R code that is understandable by someone else  


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}
outline <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~Time, ~Location, ~Topic,
  "15 minutes",   "Main" ,    "Introduce the COVID-19 case study",
  "3 hours",      "Break outs", "COVID-19 case study",
  "15 minutes",   "Main" ,   "Partner code review"
)

outline %>% 
  flextable::qflextable() %>% 
  flextable::add_footer_lines("Take breaks as you wish during the exercise")
```

# COVID-19 report

Similar to the Ebola report, we now apply our learning to a new dataset: 

* Fulton County, GA COVID-19 outbreak
* COVID-19 report provided in Word Document format

Your job is to try to recreate the tables, graphs, and written content: 

* Report is located in the course folder
* You will have 3 hours to replicate the report in an RMD
* Use the ebola code you have developed for reference

# COVID-19 Data

Scrambled and anonymized, 2 datasets:   

- Linelist, see data dictionary provided in course folder
- City populations in Fulton County  

We are starting a new project:

- Remember to create a new R project! 
- Where should the **new R project be located**?

Let's take a look at the COVID-19 data together! 


---
class: inverse, center, middle  

# Demo: COVID-19 data review

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "breakout", "window.png")))
```


---

# Support available  

- Instructors will be available in breakouts room  
- Don't be scared to ask questions, we are here to help! 
- Feel free to continue working or asking questions about the Ebola report as well


---
# Have fun  

This is not a test. Do the best you can. Enjoy reviewing about all that you have learned.

# Exercise!

Go to the course website  
Open the exercise for Module 9, and login  
Follow the instructions to start a new "covid" R project and start a new RMD script
Let an instructor know if you are unsure what to do 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "breakout", "window.png")))
```
