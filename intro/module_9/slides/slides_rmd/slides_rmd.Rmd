# Public health and routine reports: a love story  

.pull-left[

In public health we love our "automated reports".  

- Outbreak situation reports  
- Weekly slide decks  
- Executive briefings  
- Public-facing reports  
- Community health surveys  
- Vaccination survey analyses  
- ...

**Manual production is laborious and prone to human error**

]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "welcome", "automated_reports.png")))

# Public health and routine reports: a love story  



We must of assess and contextualize information at varying scales:  

.pull-left[  

- Neighborhood, postal code  
- County, district, province, state, country  
- Ethnic or occupational sub-populations  
- High-risk groups  
- Weekly, quarterly, annually  

]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "welcome", "automated_reports.png")))

**Manual production of these many reports is laborious and prone to human error**

# "Automation" v. the human eye  

.pull-left[  

"Machine learning" and "AI" are hot topics right now. 

But in most public health and applied epidemiology scenarios, these things are most important to correctly interpreting trends:  
 - Experience  
 - Local contextual knowledge  
 - Grasp of the data flow and limitations  
 
How have you experienced the limitations of "automation" in your work?

# Dashboards

{rmarkdown} scripts can easily produce simple dashboards, which you can email to your supervisor or host online!  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "flexdashboard_output.png")))
```

# Overview  

Two important things to realize:  

1) The entire script *is now a document* (extension .rmd or .Rmd)  

--

2) R code is placed inside code "chunks"  

--

3) Between chunks, you can write as in a normal text document  

--

But you get bonus features:  

- You can embed code *within normal text*  



---
# Vocabulary  

- **Markdown** - a “language” not specific to R, that allows your plain text to be converted to html and other formats (.md)  

--

- **R Markdown** - a variation on markdown that is specific to R (.Rmd)  

--

- {rmarkdown} an R package used to render the markdown (text) in the .Rmd file into the desired output  

--

- {knitr} - an R package that reads R code chunks and ‘knits’ them into the document  

--

- **Pandoc** - a separate software (but bundled with RStudio) that converts the output into word/pdf/powerpoint etc.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "0_rmd.png")))
```

.footnote[image [source](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html)]  

???
This process happens in the background, so you do not need to know all these steps. However you may encounter these names.  

The .Rmd file is fed to knitr, which executes the R code chunks and creates a new .md (markdown) file which includes the R code and its rendered output. The .md file is then processed by pandoc to create the finished product: a Microsoft Word document, HTML file, powerpoint document, pdf, etc.



---
# Select output  

Select an initial output type - don't worry you can change it later  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "1_gettingstarted.png")))
```

---
# R Markdown components  

There are three basic components to an Rmd file: YAML, Markdown text, and R code chunks

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "2_defaultRMD.png")))
```



---
# R Markdown components  

These component *become* your document:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "rmarkdown_translation.png")))
```



---
# YAML metadata  

This section at the **top of the document** specifies core settings for the production.  

Settings are written in `key: value` pairs.  

```{results='asis'}
---
title: "R is great for public health"
subtitle: "A personal testimony"
author: "Me"
date: "2022-03-15"
output: 
  html_document
---
```

???
Note that it starts and ends with three dashes, and that placement of spaces and colons are very important  



---
# R code "chunks"  

- Organize your code into chunks by discrete task/purpose (e.g. load packages, import data, data cleaning, descriptive plots, etc.)  

--

- Each chunk begins and ends with three back-ticks `

`````
```{r importing-data, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
# import data

surv_raw <- import(here("data", "surveillance_linelist_20141201.csv))
```
`````  
--

Here I can write text between my code chunks!  

--

`````
```{r, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
# clean data
surv <- surv %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(case_id, gender, age, hospital) %>% 
  mutate(child = ifelse(age < 18))
```
````` 


---
# R code chunks  

In an actual script, the chunks are easier to see:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "6_Rmdexample.png")))
```

---
# R code chunks  


`````
```{r importing-data, eval=TRUE}`r ''`  
# import data
surv_raw <- import(here("data", "surveillance_linelist_20141201.csv))
```
`````  

At the top of each chunk, within the curly brackets { }, is:  

- the letter "r" (signifying R code) and a comma , 

--

- a chunk name (optional, no spaces allowed)  

--

- other options such as: 
     - `eval = TRUE` (run the R code, or ignores it)  
     - `echo = TRUE` (displays the R code in the document)  
     - `warning = TRUE` (prints R code warnings to the document)  
     - `message = TRUE` (prints any R code message to the document)  
     - `include = TRUE` (print R outputs e.g. plots to the document)  

Many other options are possible. See the [Epi R Handbook chapter](https://epirhandbook.com/en/reports-with-r-markdown.html#code-chunks) for details.


???
Chunk names cannot contain spaces  



---
# Inline R code

This written inline code and text:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "verbatim_inline_1_1.png")))
```

produces this:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "verbatim_inline_1_2.png")))
```


---
# Inline R code

This written inline code and text:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "verbatim_inline_2_1.png")))
```

produces this:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "verbatim_inline_2_2.png")))
```

---
# R code chunks 

You may pair a code chunk with text that nicely prints the results:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "3_chunktext.png")))
```


---
# Headings and bullets  

- Headings are controlled with hash symbols #, ##, ###, ####...

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "2_text.png")))
```


---
# Tables 

This written in your R markdown:  
`````
Column 1 |Column  2 |Column 3
---------|----------|--------
Cell A   |Cell B    |Cell C
Cell D   |Cell E    |Cell F
`````

produces this:  


Column 1 |Column  2 |Column 3
---------|----------|--------
Cell A   |Cell B    |Cell C
Cell D   |Cell E    |Cell F



---
# Source mode

Your script may come to look like this:  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "source_mode.png")))
```

---
# Visual mode  

RStudio allows you to edit in "Visual Mode" which looks like a Word document


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "visual_mode.png")))
```

???
If writing the document in code is intimidating, RStudio allows you to toggle the script into "Visual Mode", so that your document looks similar to a Word document.  



---
# Running the document  

Press the "knit" button at the top. Use the drop-down for options.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "10%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "4_knitbutton.png")))
```

Progress will show in the "R Markdown" pane (next to the R Console)  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "4_progress.png")))
```

The output will save next to your .Rmd file  

???
Please see the Handbook for options to create a "Report factory" where it becomes easier to catalog outputs from many different reports in date- and time-stamped folders.  


---
# `params`  

In the YAML, you can define `params` to be available to the report:  

```{results='asis'}
---
title: "Surveillance report"
output: html_document
params:
 date: 2021-04-10
 hospital: Central Hospital
---
```

You can create the names for these params  



---
# `params`


In the R Markdown, call these `params` values in your code using: `params$`  


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "rmarkdown", "5_parameterized.png")))
```








---
# Report templates  

You can provide R Markdown with Word or PPT templates (e.g. with logos, etc.)  

Once the report is rendered, you can edit the text to add interpretations.




---
# Situation report templates  

Applied Epi works with Doctors without Borders (MSF) to offer R Markdown templates for situation reports:  

- Cholera/acute watery diarrhoea  
- Meningitis  
- Measles/Rubella  
- Acute Jaundice Syndrome (often suspected to be Hepatitis E)  

and for survey analysis:  

- Retrospective mortality and access to care  
- Vaccination coverage  
- Malnutrition
