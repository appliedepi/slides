# Overview  

In the final module of this course, you are asked to create an original R Markdown script to produce a situation report for the COVID-19 epidemic in Fulton County, Georgia, USA. After producing this report, you are asked to review the code of a partner.   

- Provide **constructive feedback** on the content, organization, readability, output, and syntax.  
- Write your comments below each bullet point, **in a different color (e.g. Red)**.  

**THIS EXERCISE IS NOT A TEST** It is simply an opportunity to try applying your new skills.  


# Output  

- Are code chunks, warnings, and messages hidden from the output?  
- Is there a title, subtitle, and date at the top of the report? (produced by the YAML)  



# Script organization

- Is the first code chunk the `setup` chunk that sets `echo = FALSE` and other R Markdown settings?  

- Is the first substantial R code chunk loading packages with {pacman}?  


# Readability

- Are the purposes of the R packages int he {pacman} command well documented with comments?  
- Are there `#` comments within the code chunks to describe the sections of code?  
- Do `#` comments use spaces well, resulting in clear and readable comments?  

- Is the R code generally "vertical" more than "horizontal" i.e. does the author use new lines and indentations successfully to improve readability?  

- Is there sufficient white space between code so the script does not look "squished" or compressed?  

- Is it easy to see where each section begins and ends?  

- Are the author's name and contact information documented somewhere near the top of the script?  


# Inline code  

- Does the "Summary" section at the top contain inline code that successfully produces a data date (June 23 2021), the total number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths (and proportion), and the number that required hospitalization?


# Syntax

- Are functions correctly written adjacent to their parentheses, like `mutate()` and not `mutate ()`?  

- Do object names (names defined by the user) use short, descriptive names? are they lowercase and use underscores if necessary? e.g. `linelist` or `joined_data` or `city_table`.  

 
# Age/Sex pyramid  

- Is there a "Demographics" header?  
- Does the pyramid show proportions? (not counts)  
- Are the X, Y, and Legend labels adjusted to display with title case? (e.g. "Gender", "Age group", and "Percent of total")  
- Is there a title? Is there a caption?  
- Are 10 year age groups used?  
- Do the colors match the template? (green/purple)  

# Epidemic curve  

- Is there a header for the Weekly Epidemic Curve by City?  
- Does the epicurve use date of report?  
- Is the color palatte matching the template, or otherwise pleasant to see?  
- Are the labels, title, and subtitle written well, to match the Template?  
- Is there a caption that produces the current number of cases, and the maximum and minimum dates of report?  
- Is the epicurve aligned at the bottom, flush with the axis ticks?  
- Are the date labels on the X-axis efficient, informative, and pleasant to read?  
- Are the y-axis break at appropriate intervals?  

# Case incidence table  
- Is the table an image (flextable) or editable?  
- Is there one row for each City?  
- Is there a column for total cases?  
- Is there a column showing the number of cases in the last 14 days?  
- Is there a column showing cumulative case incidence per 10,000 population?  
- Are the rows ordered by cumulative incidence?  
- Is there a total row at the bottom?  

# Race and outcome table  

- Is there one row per racial group?  
- Is the table results stratified by outcome (Death is Yes/No)?  
- Is there a p-value?
