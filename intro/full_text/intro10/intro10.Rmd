# Today: objectives & schedule  

**In this module we aim to help you:**  

* Apply your learning to a new dataset, without code solutions readily available  

--

* See outputs and replicate them using R  

--

* Write original R code that is understandable by someone else  

--

* Review another person's original code  

--

* Complete an end-course feedback survey  

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}
outline <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~Time, ~Location, ~Topic,
  "15 minutes",   "Main" ,    "Introduce the COVID-19 case study",
  "2 hours",      "Break outs", "COVID-19 case study",
  "45 minutes",   "Main" ,   "Partner code review" ,
  "5 minutes",    "Main",   "Closing" ,
  "15 minutes",   "Main" ,    "Feedback survey"
)

outline %>% 
  flextable::qflextable() %>% 
  flextable::add_footer_lines("Take breaks as you wish during the exercise")
```

# COVID-19 report

Fulton County, GA

You will have 2 hours to replicate the report  


---

# COVID-19 Data

Scrambled and anonymized  

- Linelist  
- City populations in Fulton County  


---

# Support available  

- Instructors will be available in breakouts room  
- Each will handle different parts of the report, so go to the room that most fits your question  


---
# Have fun  

This is not a test. Do the best you can. Enjoy reviewing about all that you have learned.  


---
# Code review  

When we re-convene, we will split into partners (randomly-assigned) and you can review the other person's code.  

We will provide a brief guide on how to review code.  


---
# Instructor feedback  

Our instructors will review your work after the course and provide you feedback by email.
