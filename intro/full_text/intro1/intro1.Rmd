# Functions   
### Inputs and outputs  

- A function is like a machine that:  
     - Receives inputs
     - Does some action with the inputs  
     - Returns an output  

--

- Functions have a name (*hopefully intuitive!*), and have parentheses ( )  
     * `print()` helps you print an R object
     * `mean()`  averages some values
     * `filter()` removes certain rows in a dataset using logical criteria

.footnote[functions also appear in Excel as *equations*]

Explain vectors `c(1, 15, 2, 9)` and a named vector `cities <- c("Wuhan", "Milan", "New York")`
Quickly note indexed vectors `cities[[2]]`

# Arguments  

.pull-left[


But most functions are not so simple.  

</br>

They must be told *how* to work, and *on what* to work.  

</br>


You use the function's **arguments** to specify these values.

Arguments are like inputs and settings, with *names*

# Packages   

.pull-left[

The functions `sqrt()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `min()` and `c()` are ready-to-use when you install R.  

These are called **{base} R** functions.



]

--

.pull-right[

However, most functions must be downloaded with their **R package**.  

For example, `tbl_cross()` is contained in the R package named {gtsummary}.  

R packages are often referred to in {brackets} and have "hex" logos.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "gt_summary.png")))
```

# Packages 

An R package is a **shareable bundle of related functions** to download and use.  
Packages typically have a theme, for example:

* **{ggplot2}** is the most common data visualization package  
* **{lubridate}** makes it easier to work with dates  
* **{janitor}** helps clean and summarize data  
* **{rmarkdown}** helps you make automated reports  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "20%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "ggplot2.png")))
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "lubridate.png")))
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "janitor.png")))
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "rmarkdown.png")))

# Install vs. Load 

.pull-left[

**Step 1 - Install**  

A package is **installed once** and stored in your R “library”.  

*The package is like a "book" of functions.*  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "library.png")))
```

]     

--

.pull-right[

**Step 2 - Load**  

Begin **every R session** by loading the packages you want to use.  

*Like borrowing a book from your library*.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

# The {pacman} package 

Using R is often a choice between approaches. We are here to coach you.

**The traditional "base R" approach**

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
install.packages("janitor") 
library(janitor) # loads

* Inefficient: re-installs every time  
* Multiple commands  
* Difficult syntax  
* Rarely necessary  

]

.pull-right[

**The "pacman" approach**  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}

* Installs packages *only if necessary*, and loads them.  
* Good for shared scripts  
* Requires the {pacman} package

# Importing data into R

# Smoothly importing data  

Recent advancements have made importing data into R much easier:  

* **RStudio projects**  
* The **`import()`** function from the **{rio}** package  
* The **{here}** package  

In this module you will use **`import()`** to import data from your **RStudio project**.  

In the next module we will discuss **{here}**.  



---
# Using `import()`  

The **`import()`** function uses the file extension (.csv, .xlsx) to understand the data type. This avoids past confusion e.g. `read_csv()`, `read.csv()`, `read_excel()`...  

.pull-left[

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import("testing_data.csv")
```

For a file in the project "root" folder,
no other information is needed... and it works on any computer!  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path. # It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "import_root.png")))
```
  
.footnote[Other importing scenarios are addressed in the next module]  

]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path. # It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "functions_packages", "rio.png")))
```

`import()` is from the {rio} package, 
shorthand for "**R** **I**nputs/**O**utputs"
