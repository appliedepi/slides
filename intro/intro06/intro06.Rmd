# Today: objectives & schedule  

**In this module we aim to help you:**  

* Understand how to get help with your code  

--

* Review common error codes and how to solve them 

--

* Learn about help documentation and other resources for code help

--

* Post a "reprex" (reproducible example) of an error in the Applied Epi Community Forum


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}
outline <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~Time, ~Location, ~Topic,
  "25 minutes",   "Main" ,    "Introduction to reprex",
  "2 hours 45 mins",   "Breakouts" ,   "Common errors; reprex post", 
  "20 minutes", "Main", "Recap"
)

outline %>% 
  flextable::qflextable() %>% 
  flextable::add_footer_lines("Take breaks as you wish during the exercise")

# Introduction to reprex 

Today we want to focus on **how to get help** with R code

There are many ways to get help beyond the course! 
* [Applied Epi R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/)
* [Applied Epi Community Forum](https://appliedepi.org/community/)
* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) or other AI resources
* [Google search](google.com), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or [Stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/)
* [Applied Epi Help Desk](support.appliedepi.org) ( you will receive coupons upon course completion)

For many of the search options, it is important to understand how to make a reproducible example.

# Introduction to reprex

What is a reproducible example (**reprex**)?

* Summarise a problem so readers can re-create it on their own computers
* Should be **minimal**: 
    * Include only data and code required to produce the problem
* Should be **reproducible**: 
    * Include *all* context required to reproduce the problem
    * E.g. packages, simplified dataframe, commands, R version used, etc.

We will go through a demonstration of how to create and post a reprex. 

Don't feel like you have to type along! You will have the opportunity to create your own in the exercises.

# Demo: How to make a reprex

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "breakout", "window.png")))
```

# This session 

Today's session is split into parts: 

**Common errors and getting help**

* Examples of common errors - can you debug them?  
* The quiz is to teach you how to understand common errors

**Creating reprexes using the ebola analysis** 

* You will have the opportunity to create two reprex examples
* Make sure to post them in the **Training** area for today! 

Remember, we are here to help, no matter where you are in the exercise.

# Exercise!

* Go to the course website  
* Open the exercise for Module 6, and login
* Follow the exercise to review common errors and answer quiz questions
* Learn about how to get help from different resources
* Create a reprex in the Applied Epi Community Forum on the Training page
* Let an instructor know if you are unsure what to do 

We will recap at the end of the session.
