## Data visualization with {ggplot2}  


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

```

# Visualization options in R  

Today we focus on {ggplot2} because it:  

* is good for fast data exploration of multi-dimensional data  
* produces very **high quality** final outputs  
* has well-structured grammar => **high consistency**  
* is accompanied by many packages that expand functionality  

See the [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) for inspiration.  

.footnote[Other plotting options include [**base** R](https://towardsdatascience.com/base-plotting-in-r-eb365da06b22), [**lattice**](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html), and [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/).]

# gg-what??  

--

- The {ggplot2} *package* is the most popular data visualization tool in R  

--

- Its `ggplot()` *function* is at the core of the package  

--

- This whole approach is colloquially known as “ggplotting”  

--

- Resulting figures are sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”  

--

**ggplot2** benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that extends its functionalities, such as **gganimate**, **ggthemr**, **ggdendro**, **gghighlight**, **ggforce**...  

.footnote[
*Bonus question:* What does the "gg” in these names represent?
]

???
- "gg" represents the “grammar of graphics” used to construct the figures 





---
# Grammar of Graphics  

Build a plot object by “adding” commands on top of one another that specify plot layers and design elements  


--

The order of layers will usually look like this:

1) **"Open" the plot** with the `ggplot()` command and specify the dataset  

--

2) **"Map" data columns** to "aesthetic" features of the plot such as axes, color, size, shape, fill, transparency  

--

3) **Add (`+`) “geom” layers** that visualize data geometrically as shapes  

--

4) **Modify "scales"**, such as a color scale or y-axis breaks  

--

5) **Add "theme" plot design elements** such as axis labels, title, caption, fonts, text sizes, background themes, or axes rotation  

--

These layers are "added" sequentially with **`+`** symbols.  
**ggplot2** commands can be quite long!  


???
Remember that although the commands may be long, it is infinitely easier to edit and recycle than in Excel

# Open the plot  

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot()                   
```

`ggplot()` creates an empty canvas.  



]

.pull-right[

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
ggplot()
```
] 

???
This is only a blank canvas, we have not defined what should be in the x and y axes. 
If several data frames are needed, they can be added in their own geoms.
Piping is useful to make one-time changes to a dataset prior to plotting.  



---
# Add the data  

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = surv)                   
```

Assign the data frame to use.  

Alternatively, use the `%>%` pipe operator to "pipe" a data frame *into* `ggplot()`  

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
surv %>%
  ggplot()
```

Plot "aesthetics" are features like position, color, shape...  

`mapping = aes()` maps "aesthetics" to columns in the data.

Aesthetic mappings are placed within `aes()`.  

Two basic mappings are axes to columns, via:  
`x = `

# A quick note on indentations  

Indentations, spaces, and newlines do not impact code execution, and can be varied to improve readability.  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = surv, mapping = aes(x = age_years, y = ht_cm))+geom_point()
```

--

is the same as:  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = surv,
       mapping = aes(x = age_yers, y = ht_cm)) +
geom_point()
```

--

is the same as:  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,        # use case linelist
  mapping = aes(      # make aesthetic mappings for all geoms
    x = age_years,    # assign x-axis to age column
    y = ht_cm)) +     # assign y-axis to height
geom_point()          # display data as points
```

.footnote[Which of the above is easier to read?]

???
- Explain why you might use one or the other 
long style can enable informative comments/annotations
- short style very dense (harder to read for some). Shorter scripts, but so what? The number of lines of your code is not an informative metric.
- very long lines => needs to scroll horizontally for people with smaller monitors (not nice)
- long-ish style makes it easier to see which argument belongs to each function
- spaces around "=" or "+" => make it easier to parse to many people
- other?

# Other aesthetics  

Aside from axes, other common "aesthetics" include: 

Argument        |Controls                
----------------|-----------------------
`shape`      |Display of point as dot, star, triangle, square...
`fill`       |The *interior* color (e.g of bar or boxplot)  
`color`      |The *exterior* or bar, boxplot - OR point color  
`size`       |Line thickness, point size...
`alpha`      |Transparency: 0 (invisible) to 1 (opaque) 
`width`      |Width of "bar plot" bars
`linetype`   |Either solid, dashed, dotted, etc.  
`binwidth`   |Width of histogram bins  
  


???

Note that “aesthetic” in ggplot has a specific meaning that you might associate with the word “aesthetics” in common English. In ggplot those details are called “themes” and are adjusted within a theme() command

Each geom accepts certain aesthetics, like `binwidth=` for `geom_histogram()`

# Aesthetics assignments  


.pull-left[

Aesthetics can be assigned to either:  

* **Static values**: `color = "purple"`  
  - Assigned *outside* `aes()`  
  - Same display for all data  

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

* **A data column**: `aes(color = gender)`  
  - Assigned *inside* `aes()`
  - Displays data as "groups"

# Static aesthetics  

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,
    y = ht_cm)) + 
*geom_point(color = "seagreen")
```


An aesthetic is *static* if it applies the same display to all data points in the geom or plot. Static aesthetics are defined *outside* `aes()` to a *number or character value*.  

Other examples:  
`size = 3`  
`alpha = 0.5`  
`width = 1.2`  

]

.pull-right[

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
     x = age_years,
     y = ht_cm)) +
geom_point(color = "seagreen") +
theme_grey(base_size = 16)

# Dynamic aesthetics   

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,
    y = ht_cm,
*   color = hospital)) +
geom_point()
```


*Dynamic* aesthetics are mapped to a column name.  

This creates "groups" and generates a legend.  

This assignment occurs *inside* `aes()`.  

Above, `color=` is mapped to column `hospital`  

]

.pull-right[

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,
    y = ht_cm,

geom_point()+
theme_grey(base_size = 16)

# Static and dynamic  

.pull-left[


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,
    y = ht_cm,
*   color = hospital)) +  
geom_point(
* size = 7, 
* alpha = 0.7) 
```

Above, `size = 7` and `alpha = 0.7` are assigned statically, outside `aes()`.  

`color=` is assigned to column `hospital`, within `aes()`.

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age_years,

    color = hospital))+      # color varies by outcome
geom_point(size = 7,         # all points 7x size
           alpha = 0.7)+     # transparency 
theme_grey(base_size = 16)     
```

As there is only one geom, all aesthetics can be written in `ggplot()`, or in `geom_point()`

# Facets  



.pull-left[

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset)) +
geom_histogram() +
*facet_wrap(~hospital)
```

Facets are "small-multiples":  
plots for one unique value 

These can be used to display groups in the data. 

`facet_wrap()` produces one facet  
per unique value of the column.  

Place a "~" before the column name.

.pull-right[

```{r }
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(x = date_onset)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_wrap(~ hospital)+

Also called "small multiples"

```

"Free" auto-scaled axes with `scales=`  
- "free_y"  
- "free_x"   
- "free" (both x and y)  

] 

.footnote[
Alert your audience if you use free axes! 
Also, try `ncol=` and `nrow=`

# Facets + `gghighlight()`

.pull-left[

ggplot extension packages like {gghighlight} are useful.  

`gghighlight()` can show a "shadow" behind each facet.  

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = date_onset,
*   fill = hospital)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_wrap(~ hospital) +
*gghighlight::gghighlight()
```

] 


.pull-right[
```{r }
ggplot(
  data = surv,
  mapping = aes(
    x = date_onset,
    fill = hospital)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_wrap(~ hospital) +
gghighlight::gghighlight() +
theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

# gghighlight

.pull-left[

Add `gghighlight()` to other plots, and specify specific values to highlight 

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
surv %>% 
  # get weekly counts by hospital
  group_by(
     hospital,
     week = floor_date(date_onset, "week")) %>%
  count() %>% 
  
  # plot
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = week,
      y = n,
      color = hospital)) +
  geom_line() +
* gghighlight::gghighlight(
*   hospital == "Port Hospital")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
```




] 


.pull-right[
```{r echo=F, eval=T}
surv %>% 
  # get daily counts by zip code
  group_by(
     hospital,
     week = floor_date(date_onset, "week")) %>%
  count() %>% 
  
  # plot
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = week,
      y = n,
      color = hospital)) +
  geom_line()+
  gghighlight::gghighlight(hospital == "Port Hospital") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

]



???
Here we create data frame of cases per week per hospital, and plot with `geom_line()`. The highlight is applied to Port Hospital.
