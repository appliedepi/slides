# slides
Slides repository for all courses

## Update slides
1. Create a branch off of main
2. Open the `slides.Rproj` and make edits. 
  Courses:
	- `intro/`
	- `intro_short/`
	- `rmd/`
	- `gis/`
	- `stats/`
	- `shiny/`
	- `time/`
2. Check they render locally by running `xaringan::infinite_moon_reader()`. Slides will appear in viewer, and will update as you edit/save.
3. Render the final slides and check HTML for errors.
4. Make a PR into main. Once merged slides will be shown on the course website when links are clicked.
