## Scenario {.exercise-slide}

It's been more than week since the last release of data on the outbreak.

While you await new data, get familiar with RStudio!

## Learning objectives

In *Part A* you will:

- Start using RStudio, including running and writing code in tidy R scripts
- Start installing and loading R packages using {pacman} and {base}

In *Part B* you will:

- Start managing your work using RStudio Projects 
- Import data using relative file paths with {rio} and {here}.

# Welcome to RStudio!

## RStudio

::: incremental
-   RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R
-   It makes using R easier with tools for writing, running, and debugging code
-   RStudio is free and widely used in data analysis and data science

# Packages

## Reminder: what are packages?

- Packages are collections of functions but also supporting files like data and documentation.
- Packages extend the capabilities of base R, allowing you to perform more specialized tasks (e.g., data manipulation and visualization).
- Packages not already in R need to be 
     - 1) installed to your computer and
     - 2) loaded to your R session, so that the functions are readily available.

(any analogy here? library books etc etc)

## Installing packages

In base R, there are two relevant functions:

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="45%"}

*1) To install a package:*

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
install.packages("dplyr")
```
<br>
*2) To load a package:*

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
library(dplyr)
```

::::
:::::::


## Installing packages

However, you need to load multiple packages separately.

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="45%"}

*1) To install a package:*

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
<br>
*2) To load a package:*

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
```

:::: {.column width="5%"}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

*Instead, you can use `p_load()`* 

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
p_load(dplyr, janitor, ggplot2)
```

This function is from {pacman}, and both installs packages if necessary and loads them.

## Installing packages

- However, pacman cannot install itself, so you will still need to install it with `install.packages()` the first time you use it!

Do we explain pacman here?

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(dplyr, janitor, ggplot2)
```

## What happens when you don't install or load a package?

If you try to use a function from an unloaded package, or if you have a typo in your code such that R does not know what package to look in, this will be the error message:
