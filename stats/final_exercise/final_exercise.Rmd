# Time to combine it all!

We are now going to take what you have learned over this course, and in your previous R experience, to create an Rmarkdown document that runs through an analysis of predictors of death due to COVID-19 infection in Fulton County, Georgia, USA.

This is real (anonymized) data and this is an example of the sort of report that could be useful in a real world situation.

---

# This is designed to be hard

Do not worry if you stumble or do not reach the end. This is all part of the learning experience and we will provide you with all the materials to create this document at the end.

Even the best of us spend a lot of our time in the Epi R Handbook and on google trying to figure out how to run commands!

---

#Objectives

.pull-left[
Read through the HTML document and look at the text, the tables and graphs. 

It will be up to you to recreate these using what you have learned! 
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
# Using here() alone won't work because Rmd folder becomes the rendering root.
# adding xfun::relative_path() creates a dynamic file path between the Rmd location and the here() path.
# It dynamically creates the ../../etc filepath.

knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "regression", "final_exercise_1.png")))
```
]

---

# Let's get to it!

Any questions?
