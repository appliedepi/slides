# Regression

.pull-left[
Regression analysis is one of the most useful tools in our toolbox. It allows us to establish statistical relationships between an outcome and an exposure, or exposures, *in our dataset*. And this allows us to do a number of different things, such as...
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "regression", "regression_figure.png")))
```
]

---

# Regression

- Testing a theory or association.
- Predicting what could happen in a new dataset if the relationships remain the same.
- Controlling for confounding and effect modification.
 - Are the relationships between the outcome and the predictor true? Or are they an artifact of another value we previously did not adjust for?
 
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "regression", "testing_test_tube.jpg")))
```

---

# gtsummary

There are many ways to carry out regressions in R, but here we will be using the package **gtsummary** as it allows us to quickly and efficiently analysis data and produce publication ready tables with ease. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::relative_path(here::here("images", "regression", "gt_logo.png")))
```

---

# gtsummary syntax

While these have numerous potential inputs (see `?tbl_uvregression` for examples for the *uniexposure* regression), we are primarily concerned with only four of them

* `method = `
  * The type of regression we want to run, set to `glm` for our purposes
* `y = `
  * The dependent (outcome) exposure we want to estimate
* `method.args = `
  * The type of glm we want to run, for a logistic regression it would be `method.args = list(family = binomial)`
* `exponentiate = `
  * Whether or not we want to exponentiate the result to produce odds ratios rather than log odds (only useful for logistic regression)

---

# gtsummary syntax

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = FALSE}
linelist %>%
  select(independent_exposures,   #The exposures we want to investigate
         outcome_death) %>%       #The outcome
     drop_na() %>%                #We can only use complete data, so we remove the rows with NA values
  tbl_uvregression(
    method = ,                
    y = ,                     
    method.args = ,           
    exponentiate =            
  )

```
]

# Univariate regression

.pull-left[
```{r univariate_code_table, echo = T, eval = F}

linelist %>%
  select(independent_exposures,   #The exposures we want to investigate
         outcome_death) %>%       #The outcome
     drop_na() %>%                #We can only use complete data, so we remove the rows with NA values
  tbl_uvregression(
    method = glm,                 #This indicates we want to use a generalized linear model     
    y = outcome_death,            #The outcome                
    method.args = list(
         family = binomial        #The distribution of the data we are fitting to
         ),           
    exponentiate = TRUE           #For logistic regression if we want the log odds we need to specify this     
  )

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r univariate_code_table-out, ref.label="univariate_code_table", echo=FALSE}
```
]

# Stratified regression

Here we define stratified regression as the process of carrying out separate regression analyses on different "groups" of data. 

We do this because we think there may be plausible reasons why relationships between the dependent and independent exposures could be different between groups

Can you think of any groups you might want to separate in your analysis? 

---

# Stratified regression

.pull-left[

* `filter()` our dataset to the group we want
 - `gender = male` and `gender = female`
* We then _remove_ gender after we filter
 - We are subsetting the data so each regression only has the `gender` data of the subset
]

.tiny[
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
male_regression <- linelist %>%
  select(independent_exposures,    #The exposures we want to investigate
         outcome_death) %>%        #The outcome
     filter(gender == "male") %>%  #The exposure we want to subset by
     select(-gender) %>%           #We remove the column we are subsetting by
     drop_na() %>%                 #We can only use complete data, so we remove the rows with NA values
  tbl_uvregression(
    method = glm,                  #This indicates we want to use a generalized linear model 
    y = outcome_death,             #The outcome     
    method.args = list(
         family = binomial         #The distribution of the data we are fitting to
         ),           
    exponentiate = TRUE            #For logistic regression if we want the log odds we need to specify this
  )

female_regression <- linelist %>%
  select(independent_exposures,    #The exposures we want to investigate
         outcome_death) %>%        #The outcome
     filter(gender == "female") %>%  #The exposure we want to subset by
     select(-gender) %>%           #We remove the column we are subsetting by
     drop_na() %>%                 #We can only use complete data, so we remove the rows with NA values
  tbl_uvregression(
    method = glm,                  #This indicates we want to use a generalized linear model 
    y = outcome_death,             #The outcome     
    method.args = list(
         family = binomial         #The distribution of the data we are fitting to
         ),           
    exponentiate = TRUE            #For logistic regression if we want the log odds we need to specify this
  )

```
]
]
---

# Comparing outputs

We can then display these tables side by side to see if there is any change in exposure assocation using `tbl_merge()`

```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
tbl_merge(tbls = list(male_regression, 
                      female_regression),
          tab_spanner = c("Male only", 
                          "Female only"))
```
---

That's it for univariate and stratified regression. 

As you can see we only need a few commands to be able to carry out a regression analysis for our dataset!

# Ready or not, we are going to give it a try!
