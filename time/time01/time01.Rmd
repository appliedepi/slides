# A little about you 

**Thank you for your service** *to your community in these busy times for public health. We are glad that you are taking the time to learn R with us.*  

Please write in the chat:

- Your name
- Your previous R experience
- A quick summary of your day-to-day job
- If you want to aim for:
    - Target 1 (data cleaning + are cases going up?)
    - Target 2 (are the cases higher than expected?)
    - Target 3 (extras)

---

# Time series

- A set of observations arranged in chronological order
- Performed in many fields, many applications
- We will be focusing on "anomaly detection" (also known as "aberration analysis")
- Used in near real-time surveillance to identify unexpected patterns in data
- Allows for informed decision-making and outbreak detection

---

# Words are important

You always have "**recorded** cases" or "**recorded** deaths", not "cases" or "deaths".

What is an outbreak?

- The occurrence of disease cases in excess of normal expectancy.
- Might go unnoticed if there is poor surveillance.
- If noticed, might not be declared an outbreak for political reasons.

What is a week?

- Week = 7 day period
- Isoweek* = ?
- Epiweek = ?
- Seasonweek = ?


.footnote[*Remember that isoweeks must be used with isoyears, not calendar years.]

# Scenario 1: No historical data

Lets consider a situation where we have no historical data (or in the absence of consistent seasonal patterns).

Reasons for this may be:

- Opened a new health clinic in a new geographical region.
- Included a new disease in your surveillance system (e.g. RSV).
- Started a temporary surveillance system for an outbreak/new situation.
- Novel disease has been found (e.g. HIV in 1983, COVID-19 in 2019).
- Disease does not have a seasonal pattern (e.g. COVID-19 in 2023).
- Fundamental changes in the surveillance system (e.g. COVID-19 testing requirements changing, health infrastructure destroyed in conflict).

From a statistical perspective, all of these situations are the same.

All of these situations can occur anywhere.

---

## How can we describe the epidemiological situation?

**Magnitude**

- E.g. Number of recorded cases, hospitalizations, deaths.

**Trend**

- E.g. Increasing/not increasing
- Decreasing is more difficult

---

# Magnitude

*WARNING*: **Categorizing** magnitude is often not **statistical**, especially with limited historical data.

There is no objective measure of how much infection or disease is "too much" in a population. Acceptable levels are determined by the population, health authorities, and political class.

If a society adopts an elimination or suppression strategy, no amount of disease spread is acceptable.

**First**, present your data neutrally with scientific integrity:

- Show real numbers (**avoid categorizing as low/medium/high**).
- When comparing populations of different sizes (e.g., 100 deaths/1M vaccinated vs. 10 deaths/10 unvaccinated), consider displaying rates (e.g., deaths/100k people).

**Then**, interpret the data or leave it to the reader.

# Prediction vs. Confidence

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Confidence Interval (CI)**: Estimates a range for the *average outcome* in a population.
   - **Prediction Interval (PI)**: Estimates a range for a *single future outcome* in a population.

2. **Uncertainty**:
   - **CI**: Shows how confident we are about the *mean* of the population.
   - **PI**: Shows the likely range for a *new observation* from the population.

3. **Size of the Interval**:
   - **PI** is usually wider than a **CI** because it accounts for the extra uncertainty of predicting an individual outcome.
   - **(Uncertainty of estimating the mean)** + **(random variability of a single observation)**

We have created a **prediction** interval using the baseline data.

(**Not a confidence interval!**)

The upper bound of the prediction interval is often called the **threshold**.

How to improve?
- Wider window 
    - More data
    - More power
    - Worse adjustment for seasonality
- Narrower window
    - Better adjustment for seasonality
