# If you are unable to begin using RStudio on your computer, 
# you may go to this address:   https://rstudio.appliedepi.org/app/rstudio

# You will see RStudio, in an online manner.

# Open a new R script and paste this code below.
# We recommend that you also write any modifications/new code here in this text file,
# because if you close the internet session you will need to start over. 


# install {pacman} R package
# note: this online environment will not remember prior sessions/installations.
# note: so, you must install pacman each time you begin working in this environment.
install.packages("pacman")


# use {pacman} to efficiently install/load other R packages
pacman::p_load(rio, here, janitor, tidyverse)


# import dataset
# note: the use of system.file() is unique to this online RStudio environment.
# note: normally, you would use here() to locate the file inside the RStudio project
surv_raw <- import(system.file("dat/surveillance_linelist_20141201.csv", package = "introexercises"))

Notes for tomorrow:
